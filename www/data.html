data :
{sensors: [ 
  {ip : The IP of the Virtual machine where the Leap Motion sensor is connected <br/>
	positionX : the coordinate X of the sensor on the table  <br/>
	positionY : the coordinate Y of the sensor on the table <br/>
  rotation : the coordinate X of the sensor on the table <br/>
  dump : the returned data from dump() method of Frame , a JSON-formatted string containing the hands, and pointables in this frame.<br/>
  toString : the returned data from toString() method of Frame, a string containing a brief, human readable description of the Frame object.<br/>
  hands : [
    {palmPosition : the center position of the palm in millimeters from the Leap origin.<br/>
    grabStrength : the strength of a grab hand pose.<br/>
  confidence : A low value indicates that there are significant discrepancies; finger positions, even hand identification could be incorrect<br/>
  direction : The direction from the palm position toward the fingers <br/>
  palmNormal : The normal vector to the palm. If your hand is flat, this vector will point downward, or “out” of the front surface of your palm. <br/>
  palmVelocity: The rate of change of the palm position in millimeters/second.<br/>
  palmWidth : The average outer width of the hand (not including fingers or thumb) in millimeters.<br/>
  pinchStrength : The holding strength of a pinch hand pose<br/>
  sphereCenter : The center of a sphere fit to the curvature of this hand. <br/>
  sphereRadius : The radius of a sphere fit to the curvature of this hand, in millimeters.<br/>
  stabilizedPalmPosition : The stabilized palm position of this Hand.<br/>
  type : string value either “right” or “left”, identifies whether this Hand is a right or a left hand. <br/>
  toString : A string containing a brief, human readable description of the Hand object.;<br/>
  roll : The roll angle in radians.<br/>
  pitch : The pitch angle in radians.
<br/>  yaw : The yaw angle in radians.  
  <br/>arm = {  //The Bone class represents a tracked arm bone.
    <br/>basis :  The orthonormal basis vectors for this Bone
    <br/>width : The average width of the fleshy part surrounding this bone.
    <br/>center : The midpoint of this bone in millimeters within the Leap Motion coordinate system
    <br/>matrix : The transformation describing the bone orientation and position within the Leap Motion coordinate system. 
    <br/>nextJoint : The distal end of the bone closest to the finger tip.
    <br/>prevJoint: The proximal end of the bone closest to the torso
    <br/>direction : The direction vector along the bone’s longitudinal axis.
    <br/>type : The code for the anatomical identity of this bone:
<br/>          0 = Metacarpal
    <br/>      1 = Proximal phalanx
<br/>          2 = Intermediate phalanx
<br/>          3 = Distal phalanx
<br/>          4 = forearm
  <br/>},
  <br/>fingers: [ 
  <br/>{bones : an array containing the finger bones whose ordered from wrist to finger tip (metacarpal, proximal, intermediate, and distal)
<br/>  type : a code indicating the finger's  anatomical name 
  <br/>extended : True, if the finger is a pointing, or extended, posture.    toString = data.toString() 
  <br/>carpPosition : The physical position of the base end of the metacarpal bone of the finger (closest to the wrist).
<br/>  dipPosition : The physical position of the distal interphalangeal joint of the finger. This point is the base of the distal bone (closest to the intermediate phalanx).
<br/>  mcpPosition : The physical position of the metacarpophalangeal joint, or knuckle, of the finger. This position is the joint between the metacarpal and proximal phalanx bones.
  <br/>pipPosition : The physical position of the proximal interphalangeal joint of the finger. This position is the joint between the proximal and the intermediate phalanges.
<br/>  tipPosition : The tip position in millimeters from the Leap origin, finger class extended from pointable class, then a finger has all the attributes as pointable class (https://developer-archive.leapmotion.com/documentation/javascript/api/Leap.Pointable.html#Pointable)
<br/>  length : The estimated length of the finger in millimeters.
  <br/>timeVisible : The amount of time this pointable has been continuously visible to the Leap Motion controller in seconds.
<br/>  width : The estimated width of the finger in millimeters. 
  <br/>bones: [

    <br/>center : The midpoint of this bone in millimeters within the Leap Motion coordinate system
    <br/>matrix : The transformation describing the bone orientation and position within the Leap Motion coordinate system. 
<br/>    nextJoint : The distal end of the bone closest to the finger tip.
